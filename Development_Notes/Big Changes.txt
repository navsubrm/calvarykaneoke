1. Look at moving all large components to a page.  On componentize small reusable pieces.

2. Use the Broadcast Channel api to create an edit page that is connected to the real page and shows updates in real time.  
Or better yet, have it open a dummy page at a dev url to see changes before saving.  It would open up the page edit window to be managed more cleanly.

It works.  Look at creating a completely separate edit branch with access control. 

The user will navigate to the protected edit form, and select edit page.  That will open the page in a new tab and forward the page data back to the editor.  Open the editor channel.

It could help also to separate the form bindings so that the forms donâ€™t fail to load.  I could set the value on the page fetch.  Then it will push the updates to the page for viewing.
