This will be important when handling downloadable assets: 

        const existingPdfBytes: ArrayBuffer | undefined = await platform?.env.ASSETS.fetch(
				TEMPLATE
			).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer());

You need to fetch asset from the ASSETS fetcher.  This can be typed by adding "ASSETS: Fetcher;" to the app.d.ts app/env section.
